Our presentation shows the probability of a given crime occuring to someone on a given day, based on data from 2010-2015 in New York City. The background colors of the map indicated average income level (lightest is lower). 

This visualization was our submission to the Carolina Data Challenge 2017, where we took runner-up in the Best Beginner category. 

This repository holds the Jupyter Notebook used to clean the data with Python's Pandas library.
